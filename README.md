DevOps Project: Java Login Application
Welcome to the DevOps Project: Java Login Application! This project aims to develop a secure login system using Java and various DevOps practices.

Overview:
This Java application provides a login system with authentication and authorization features. Users can securely log in to the system using their credentials.

Features:
User Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves using their username and password.
Authorization: The application supports role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain resources based on user roles.
Security: The login system is designed with security in mind, implementing best practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
Technologies Used:
Java: The core programming language used for building the application logic.
Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java applications, providing features such as dependency injection and web development support.
Docker: Utilized for containerizing the application, enabling consistent deployment across different environments.
Jenkins: Used for continuous integration (CI) to automate the build and testing processes.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform. This project is hosted on GitHub.

How to Use:
To use the Java Login Application, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone <repository_url>

Build the Application: Build the Java application using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle). Ensure that all dependencies are installed and configured properly.

Run the Application: Run the application locally to test its functionality. Use the provided instructions in the project documentation for guidance.

Deployment: Once the application is tested and ready, deploy it to your desired environment. Docker can be used to containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
